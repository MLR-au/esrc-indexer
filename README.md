to support our environment. See: https://bitbucket.org/esrc/scholarly-python2
(though note that it it's likely out of date compared to our active build).

Run python Indexer.py -h for a list of options. A configuration file is
required, to specify indexing options. You can copy the included
indexer.cfg.example file to a new location and edit it as needed.
